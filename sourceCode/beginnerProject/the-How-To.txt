First times the charm

Right, so I'm too lazy to explain everything right now so I'll just explain some of it. 

Software
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need the Arduino IDE downloaded to your PC or Mac (link on the homepage idiot). After the download, you need to install 
the software. After you hopefully installed it correctly, open the program. You will need to go to the "File" tab, scroll down to the 
"Preferences" tab and click it. You will get another window titled "Preferences". Go down to "Additional Boards Manager URL: " and add this 
link: http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json. After that click "Ok" at the bottom of the page. 

Next, go to the "Tools" tab and hover over "Board: ". You will get another popup and go to the top and click "Boards Manager...". Then 
search for "ESP8266" and hover over "esp8266 by ESP8266 Community" and install it. You can close the window when installation is complete. 
So go back to the "Tools" tab in your IDE and hover over "Boards: " again and scroll down until you get a greyed out "ESP8266 Boards
header. Then select your board (mine was "Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266" so i would click that). 

Great, not that hard, right? So now you have the correct board selected. You can then download and open the ".ino" file in this folder 
(it 
should automatically open in the Arduino IDE application). Connect your board to the computer with a micro usb cable (picture on the 
front 
page again dumbass) and wait for your computer to recognize it. Once that is done, go to the "Tools" tab once again and go down to the 
port 
tab. Make sure your device is selected (to avoid confusion, try to use one board at a time). And for the final step, just click the 
arrow facing to the right in the top right corner of the window to flash the software onto your device. It may take a minute, and if you get a few errors, thats fine. Once flashing is complete, you can unplug the esp and go to the hardware setup.

Hardware

Just get the parts required and follow my image example. 

Once your piece looks like my picture, you can just plug the esp into a power source and watch the magic (hopefully) happen!
