# ESP8266_breadboard_circuits
These are some example breadboard circuits I made with a Huzzah ESP8266. 

If you want to make these projects yourself, you are going to need the following (if you are not sure what these pieces look like, I will have a picture of them in the images folder):

-A breadboard (I used one from a RPI3 Canakit)

-Some led lights

-Esp8266 with micro usb (I used the Huzzah Feather specifically)

-Breadboard buttons

-Computer to program the esp8266 (mac or pc is fine)

-Arduino IDE for your computer (https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)

-A brain
